\chapter{Numerical Methods of Solving Differential Equation}
There are points were you can't solve a differential equation by normal means. You can use methods listed here to solve it numerical, meaning trying to find an approximate solution. These methods will also include methods of finding the error in the measurements. 

\section{Euler's Method}
\section{Taylor Series Expansion}
