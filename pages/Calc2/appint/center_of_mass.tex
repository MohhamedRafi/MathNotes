\subsection{Center of Mass}
Center of mass can be very interesting and involved application of integrals. 

\paragraph*{To find the center of mass alongside} a line, we need to refer to Archimedes' Law of Lever: where a rod will be balanced, 
if $m_1d_1$ = $m_2d_2$, $m$ is the mass alongside the rod, and $d$ is the distance between the $\bar{x}$ and the mass, where that is the center posiition. 

\subparagraph*{We} can write $d$ in terms of the $\bar{x}$ and the position of the mass. 

\begin{align}
	d_1 &= \bar{x} - x_1 \\ 
	d_2 &= x_2 - \bar{x} \\ 
	m_1(\bar{x} - x_1) &= m_2(x_2-\bar{x}) \\ 
	m_1\bar{x} - m_1x_1 &=m_2x_2-m_2\bar{x} \\ 
	m_1\bar{x}+m_2\bar{x} &= m_1x_1+m_2x_2 \\ 
	\bar{x} &= \frac{m_1x_1+m_2x_2}{m_1+m_2}
\end{align}
